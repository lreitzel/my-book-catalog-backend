# README

Hello! This is the backend/API for the program "My Reading Catalog", a personal tracker where you can store books that you want to read, or have already read! 

To use this program, please fork and clone this repository, then on your local machine, run 'bundle install'. Next set up your database by running 'rails db:migrate'. Next, you can run 'rails s' to get the API running. Your API information can be checked by going to 'localhost:3000/genres'.

For the full application, you can also add the frontend by going to this link: https://github.com/lreitzel/my-book-catalog-frontend. Once you've got the rails server running here, you'll be ready to begin setting up the frontend.

Thank you and enjoy your time with 'My Reading Catalog'!
